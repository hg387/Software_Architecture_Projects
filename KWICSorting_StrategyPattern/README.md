README for SE311-Hw1

<br/>Task: KWIC sorting of lines, A KWIC index is formed by sorting and aligning the words within an article title to allow each word (except the stop words) in titles to be searchable alphabetically in the index.[3] It was a useful indexing method for technical manuals before computerized full text search became common.
  
<br/>1) Main class acts as Client and class to run the program.
<br/>2) test1.txt and test2.txt are the example provided in the hw1 documentation.
<br/>3) test1Result.txt and test2Result.txt are the output files generated from test1.txt
and test2.txt respectively.
<br/>4) For the Strategy Pattern, Input and Output are the abstract Strategies.
<br/>5) InputConsoleTasker and InputFileTasker are the concrete Strategies of Input.
<br/>6) Similarly, OutputConsoleTasker and OutputFileTasker are the concrete Strategies of Output.
<br/>7) UML.png contains the UML diagram for this homework.

<br/>Note: The console input for sentences allows users to input multiple lines. Press Enter after
every line to input the next line. To Proceed, whenever you entered the last line, just press 
enter again to go to the next line and press enter again to proceed. 

<br/>Note: The UML is the auto-generated so, aggregation/compostion logic is bit fuzzy showing all
these relationships shown as composition. However, these classes can exist own its owns so, 
take these relationships as aggregation.
