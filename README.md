These Projects are implemented to provide an introduction to software architecture concepts and to 
show those concepts in action, through examples, case studies and hands-on work with 
different architectures and supporting technology. <br/>

It also provide an introduction to software architecture concepts and to 
show those concepts in action, through examples, case studies and hands-on work with 
different architectures and supporting technology. <br/>

Objectives Achieved:
<br/>• Further understand design concepts and how different domains are abstracted into 
architecture and design. 
<br/>• Understand design of existing software systems from an architectural perspective. 
<br/>• Be able to design new systems in principled ways using well-understood architectural 
paradigms and styles.
<br/>• Be able to describe and document designs using existing architectural description 
models. 
<br/>• Be able to implement new systems according to their architectural descriptions.
<br/>• Be able to evaluate and compare design architectures from quality-related 
perspectives
